# Diagnostic Gap (DX Gap)

Diagnostics are essential to deliver quality healthcare. But today, diagnostic gaps prevent people from accessing the care they need exacerbating health inequities.

Until testing is available to all the UN global goal for universal health coverage by 2030 will remain elusive.

## Barriers to diagnosis

**5 main barriers** prevent diagnosis for all in low and middle-income countries. But innovative solutions can right this inequity.

These solutions are aligned with findings of *the 2021 Lancet Commission on diagnostics* showing the way to accelerate and transform access to testing globally.

## 1. diagnostic tests today are beyond the reach of millions

- How many health facilities with testing capacity
- GDP x capita
- Number of people living in rural / urban areas
- Tests costs (what economic factors of country can affect the cost of tests?)

When patients walk into a health facility, the first step is to identify what’s making them sick.
But only 1% of the primary care clinics where most people seek care in *low and middle-income countries* have the *capacity for basic diagnostics*.

Instead, *many diagnostic tools are restricted to centralized hospitals or laboratories* if available at all.
For the world’s poor and vulnerable people who live in *remote areas* testing is an unaffordable luxury that’s simply beyond their reach.

**Everyone who needs a test should be able to get one.** Essential tests must be affordable and available at all primary care centers.

## 2. Many diagnostic tools aren't adapted to local realities

Lack of stable *power supply, clean water, controlled temperature and reliable internet connection* are just some of the challenges that can prevent testing.

Beyond the physical environment healthcare workers also often *lack the training* to effectively conduct some tests and interpret their results especially more complex ones.

**Tests should be suitable for use where they are needed.**

Co-development with local partners ensures tools are fit-for-purpose and they must be supported by adequate training.

## 3. The reliability of tests is not always guaranteed

The right care decision relies on consistently trusting test results.

This can be impacted by the need for rigorous quality control of tests and the costly and constant struggle for maintaining laboratory equipment.

Access to External Quality Assurance programme that could enhance laboratory performance can be limited. Trust depends on safe quality tests.

National governance and regulatory frameworks are needed for control, simplicity and harmonization.
COVID-19 has shown the world that the value of diagnostics goes far beyond the right care decision for any individual person.

## 4. Limited use of diagnostic data hampers decision-making

It also provides the data decision-makers need to identify problems take effective public health decisions
and monitor impact of interventions.

Yet, many facilities still rely on paper-based *reporting systems* which can result in delays, errors and data losses.

And the lack of common standards for data management also prevents timely reporting.

*Data capacity building must become a priority.*


## 5. Inefficient diagnostic systems drive up costs to patients and health systems

It’s the path to improve efficiency and disease surveillance to enable early detection and rapid response to new pathogens.

Diagnostic networks are highly complex, involving multiple health facilities, laboratories and tools.

All shaped by local factors and unique budgetary constraints.

Isolated settings also make transport of samples to laboratories extremely challenging.

The difficulty of anticipating priority needs for testing and the fragility of supply chains can easily delay services and the return of results.

Efficiency requires better planning and management solutions.

These should guide the procurement, and funding of resources to where they’re needed most.

Solutions exist to turn the tide and make testing an integral part of sustainable and resilient health systems.

Testing must become a global priority by creating national diagnostics strategies advocating for testing at all levels to ensure these strategies receive appropriate funding and harnessing partners’ strengths as part of a global alliance that can finally bring us closer to health for all.
